              <p>Yo Gonzo started as a hobby, helping friends cover their events and private parties until I realized my talent behind the lens. After bringing the new concept of "light painting" to the clubs I rapidly gained popularity and even after being booked at some of the best parties in the Tri-State area I was not fully satisfied in just club gigs. Throughout the next few months I began shooting everything, from landscapes/sceneries to models to family photos. Finding my niche in natural light portraits and bringing life to low light environments. By never being comfortable and always broadening my horizons there is no stopping me from achieving perfection.</p>
